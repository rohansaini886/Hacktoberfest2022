  Stacks --->
Stack follows LIFO principle.
Stack is a container which allows PUSH and POP operations.
PUSH --> Placing an element on the top of the stack
POP --> Removing an element from the top of the stack.

Time complexity(Push & Pop) :- O(1) in both arrays and linked lists.

Queues --->
Queue follows FIFO principle.
Queue is a container which allows enqueue and dequeue operations.
Enqueue --> Placing an element in a queue at rear end.
Dequeue  --> Removing an element from a queue at front end.

Time complexity(Enqueue & Dequeue) :- O(1) in both arrays and linked lists.

Circular queue -->
